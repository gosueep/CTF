You have been asked for help to decrypt a message that the NSA believes to be
related to a terrorist plot in the coming days. This terrorist cell has been known
to use code words to encrypt messages. We believe they share code words amongst
themselves using a different encryption mechanism. Below is a transcript that was
pulled from communication between a new member of this terrorist cell and his
superior.

JohnDoe: Welcome to the team!

CoolDude: Thanks. I received the two pieces of encryption software. I think that I
have the key for the first, but I want to confirm. Is there a secure way to do
that?

JohnDoe: Sure. Run the following through the program and you should get the
resulting outputs.
	pinecone

CoolDude: Looks good. It appears that I have the correct starter key.

JohnDoe: Yesterday, we made a modification to the first piece of encryption software
to make it more obscure. The second encryption routine remains the same since it is
a more difficult algorithm to break. Update your first encryption routine using the
attached patcher.

[JohnDoe sent you an attachment .]

JohnDoe: We can use the same initial key, but use the modified encryption routine.
To confirm that the modification was successful, compare the following results.

CoolDude: Thanks. It appears to be working. Still using that output as the key to
the second encryption routine?

JohnDoe: No comment, newbie. Let's minimize chatter.
