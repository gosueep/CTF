Creating a CUDA program to recover an elliptic curve key using side-channel techniques is a highly specialized task that involves both cryptography and parallel computing. While side-channel attacks, such as those based on timing or power analysis, can be very effective in practice, implementing them is complex and requires a deep understanding of both the specific elliptic curve being attacked and the details of the side-channel information.

Here's a basic outline of how one might approach writing a CUDA program for this task. This is a highly simplified example and is meant to illustrate the general approach rather than a full, working implementation. A real-world implementation would need to handle many more details and security considerations.

### Requirements

1. **CUDA Toolkit**: Make sure you have the CUDA toolkit installed and set up.
2. **Elliptic Curve Library**: You might need an elliptic curve library that supports CUDA. For simplicity, we will not include the full library in this example.

### High-Level Steps

1. **Gather Side-Channel Data**: Collect side-channel information that includes intermediate elliptic curve point coordinates. This is usually done through hardware-based attacks and not part of the CUDA code itself.

2. **Setup CUDA Environment**: Initialize CUDA and allocate memory for data transfer.

3. **Implement Attack Logic**: Use the collected side-channel data to infer the private key. This will involve computations on elliptic curve points and might involve reverse engineering based on the observed data.

### Simplified CUDA Example

Here's a simplified example that demonstrates the structure of such a program. This example does not include a real elliptic curve implementation or side-channel data, but it shows how you might set up and use CUDA to process data in parallel.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// CUDA kernel to process elliptic curve data
__global__ void processEllipticCurveData(float* d_data, float* d_results, int dataSize) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < dataSize) {
        // Example computation: just copy data for illustration
        d_results[idx] = d_data[idx] * 2.0f; // Dummy operation, replace with actual elliptic curve logic
    }
}
