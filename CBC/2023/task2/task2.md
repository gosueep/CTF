Thanks to your efforts the USCG discovered the unknown object by trilaterating the geo and timestamp entries of their record with the correlating entries you provided from the NSA databases. Upon discovery, the device appears to be a balloon with some kind of collection array used for transmitting and receiving. Further visual inspection shows the brains of this device to be reminiscent of a popular hobbyist computer. Common data and visual ports non-responsive; the only exception is a boot prompt output when connecting over HDMI. Most interestingly there is a 40pin GPIO header with an additional 20pin header. Many of these pins show low-voltage activity which indicate data may be enabled. There may be a way to still interact with the device firmware...

Find the datasheet that might be closest to this hardware, and then use it and the resourses provided to discover which pins enable data to and from the device

boot_prompt.log -> **ALT0 mode used**

UART GPIO: 14,15
14: TXD0
15: RXD0

Relate this back to the datasheet in the svg:
Power: P1 (3.3V)
Ground: P6
UART Transmit: P19 (corresponds to 15)
UART Receive: P21 (corresponds to 15)
